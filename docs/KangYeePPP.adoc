== Introduction

This project portfolio briefly introduces the project, treasurerPro and outlines my contributions to the project
and explains the feature I implemented.

=== About the team

My team consists of 5 software engineering students under the module CS2103T. 4 of us, including me, are year 2
Computer Science students and the other is a year 4 Computer Engineering student.

=== About the project

This project is part of the module Software Engineering Project, CS2103T where we were tasked to develop a basic
command line interface <<CLI>>
desktop application by morphing or enhancing an existing AddressBook desktop application.
Our team decided to incorporate and morph the AddressBook application as part of our all-in-one application which
enables treasurers or members of Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Clubs and Societies to manage their club finances,
reimbursements to members, inventory and member’s contact details easily.

=== Introduction of treasurerPro

This desktop application consists of 6 tabs, a command box for users to input their commands and a response box
for Leo, our lion mascot. Each tab serves a different purpose that helps treasurers and members better manage their club
or Society's finances. The home tab keeps track of individual transactions. The members tab keep track of all contact
details of members. The reimbursement tab keeps track of reimbursement records for members that have spent for the club.
The inventory tab keeps track of items for sale. The cashier tab is a convenient way for the club or society to do
cashiering duties which helps to directly input sales into the system. The overview tab allows treasurers to plan the
club or society's finances.

This is what our application looks like when it is first opened. (graphical user interface for treasurerPro):

== Summary of contributions
My role was to design and write the codes for the features of the `Home Tab`. The following sections illustrate these
enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides in
relation to these enhancements.

=== Enhancements
I added the enhancements of the different commands for the Home Tab.

==== Add, Delete and Edit Commands
The basic create, read, update and delete (CRUD) commands were added such that the user can [blue]`*add*`, [blue]`*delete*` and
[blue]`*edit*` transactions to keep track of them.

* What it does:
It allows the user to create, delete and update transactions. It also allows the application to restore data from
previous usage of the application by reading and saving data in a background text file.

* Justification:
It forms the fundamental features required for the `Home Tab` to be useful for users to keep track of transactions.

* Highlights:
These commands help to store and keep track of transactions in the `Home Tab` but also help keep track of sales
transactions from the `Cashier Tab`. The transactions for each member's spending in this tab are also tabulated in the
`Reimbursement Tab` to help the treasurer keep track of pending reimbursements.

==== Sort Command

A [blue]`*sort*` command was also implemented for the transactions in the table to sort the commands to a certain order.

* What it does:
The addition of transactions requires the user to input the date, description, category, amount of money and
person accountable for each transaction. Thus, this command helps to sort the transactions by the alphabetical order of
the person's name, by the date (from oldest to most recent) or amount (from largest to smallest).

* Justification:
It is useful for users to keep track of transactions and view the transaction records according to different
priority.

* Highlights:
This command can be extended easily to allow for sorting of transactions in the reverse order.

==== Find Command

A [blue]`*find*` command was also implemented to help find specific transactions that match the keywords inputted by the user.

* What it does:
The command allows user to filter out the transactions to only show those that match the keywords from all
the transactions recorded.

* Justification:
This allows users to easily find and filter out transactions to call another command to manage the transactions
better.

==== Go and Exit Command

Lastly, a [blue]`*go*` command and [blue]`*exit*` command was implemented to help navigate to another tab
and leave the application.

* What it does:
The [blue]`*go*` command helps the user to navigate to another tab without having to click on the tab and the
[blue]`*exit*` command allows the user to leave the application without having to click on the window's exit icon
as well.

* Justification: This ensures the application is a command-line interface application which requires no clicking
at all.

== Contributions to the User Guide
=== Current enhancement
=== Proposed enhancement for v2.0

==  Contributions to the Developer Guide
The following section shows my additions to the treasurerPro Developer Guide for the `Home Tab` features.

=== Current enhancement
(start of extract from Developer Guide)

[very big]##3.1 Home Tab##

This tab will help to show records of individual transactions from miscellaneous spending, revenue from sales and
cost of buying items to sell.

Each transaction will require an input of its date, description, category, amount
and member that is accountable for it.

Revenue from each cashier checkout will also be automatically inputted as
a positive transaction in this tab with the person being the cashier. The inputted transactions that corresponds to
a spending will be tabulated for each member in the reimbursement tab to keep track of reimbursements.


This is the overall Class Diagram of this tab:

image::HomeTabClassDiagram.png[]
[italic small red]*Figure 9. Class Diagram of Home Tab (transaction package)*

[big]##3.1.1 Add Command feature##

The Add Command is facilitated by the `VersionedtreasurerPro`. This feature requires access to the `Model` of the
person package which the `AddressBook` implementation is contained in. All fields in the transactions are compulsory
to be inputted by the user: date, description, category, amount, person full name. The person's name inputted
has to match a name already existing in the `AddressBook` which is shown in our Members Tab.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add command works:

image::HomeTabAddCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]
[italic small red]*Figure 10. Sequence Diagram of Add Command in Home Tab (transaction package)*

The following activity diagram shows the steps needed to add a new transaction:

image::HomeTabActivityDiagramAddCommand.png[]
[italic small red]*Figure 11. Activity Diagram of Add Command in Home Tab (transaction package)*

As shown, when a user does not input all the compulsory fields or input a name that does not match anyone in
the `AddressBook`, a response to inform the user of the incorrect input is shown and when a successful addition is
done, a response message is shown as well by our mascot, Leo.

In addition, since the `resetPredicate()` method is called as shown, the UI table will immediately show the full
transaction list regardless of the list at the start of the activity diagram showing the filtered list
due to prior the inputted Find Command.

Since the reimbursement tab tabulates the amount to be reimbursed to a person, if the inputted amount is a negative
amount to indicate a spending that needs to be reimbursed, the reimbursement tab will update and show this record.

[[update-reimbursement-ppp]]The following sequence diagram shows how the reimbursement `Model` and `Storage` is updated.

image::TransactionUpdatingReimbursement.png[]
[italic small red]*Figure 12. Sequence Diagram of updating Reimbursement Tab (reimbursement package)*

This is done for every feature in the `LogicManager`.

[big]##3.1.2 Delete Feature##

The Delete Command is facilitated by the `VersionedtreasurerPro`. This feature allows for 2 types of deletion, by
the index shown in the table or by the person's name. Inputting the person's name will cause all transactions linked to
that person to be deleted.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete by name command works:

image::HomeTabDeleteByNameCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]
[italic small red]*Figure 13. Sequence Diagram of Delete Command in Home Tab (transaction package)*

After this, the reimbursement tab is updated as shown in <<update-reimbursement-ppp, Figure 12>>.
The delete by index implementation would be similar but does not require interaction with the `Model` from the
`AddressBook` in the person package.

The following activity diagram shows the steps needed to delete a new transaction:

image::HomeTabActivityDiagramDeleteCommand.png[]
[italic small red]*Figure 14. Activity Diagram of Delete Command in Home Tab (transaction package)*

The above activity diagram assumes the index to be within the bounds of the table but if it is not, a response will
be shown about the incorrect input. Also, as shown above, response on other incorrect inputs will also be shown.
When a successful deletion is done, a response message is shown as well.

In addition, since the `resetPredicate()` method is not called as shown, the UI table will continue to show the
filtered transaction list if the prior input is a Find Command and the list at the start of the activity diagram shows
a filtered list by the Find Command's keywords. To view the full transaction list, the user would have to input the
Back Command that calls `resetPredicate()`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the back command works:

image::HomeTabBackCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]
[italic small red]*Figure 15. Sequence Diagram of Back Command in Home Tab (transaction package)*

[big]##3.1.3 Sort Feature##

The Sort Command is facilitated by the `VersionedtreasurerPro`. This feature allows for 3 types of sort, by name in
alphabetical order, by amount (from most to least) and by date (from oldest to most recent).

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort command works:


image::HomeTabSortCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]
[italic small red]*Figure 16. Sequence Diagram of Sort Command in Home Tab (transaction package)*

When a user inputs the sort command, it is only checked that it is one of the 3 types or it will show a response about
the incorrect user input. When it is successfully sorted, there will also be a response message shown.

Similar to the Delete Command, since the `resetPredicate()` method is not called as shown, the UI table will
continue to show the filtered transaction list if the prior input is a Find Command and the list at the start
of the activity diagram shows a filtered list by the Find Command's keywords.
To view the full transaction list, the user would have to input the
Back Command that calls `resetPredicate()`.

=== Glossary

[[CLI]] Command line interface (CLI): Command line interface applications allow users to use all the features in the app by typing and without a need to click on anything

[[PR]] Pull request (PR): Making a pull request is a way of submitting contributions to an open development project. It allows the developers to approve code before
it is added or merged with the current code in the project.

[[GUI]] Graphical user interface (GUI): Refers to the visual means of interacting with the application, such
as windows, buttons and menus.

[[TravisCI]] Travis CI: Travis will automatically detect when a commit has been made and pushed to the GitHub repository that allows it access,
and each time this happens, it will try to build the project and run tests according to the standards set by the developers.
