== Introduction

treasurerPro (tP) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their club expenses*.
More importantly, tP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, tP can get your expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Feature Specific Commands

These are commands that are specific to each feature which would be categorised into tabs in our application.

=== Home

====
* Home tab shows the transaction history of each expenditure.
* The columns will show the date/time of the transaction, description of the expenditure, category it is under, amount spent and the person who bought it.
* At the side, our mascot lion 'Leo' will help to give replies to indicate successful addition, deletion, edits of the command line input.
* He will also give you replies when there is a wrong input.
* There is a function to sort the transactions by date so from latest to oldest, person so by alphabetical order of the person and amount so from most to least.
* The amount should be inputted as positive if the transaction is considered revenue and adds to the club or society's reserves
and the amount should be inputted as negative if the transaction is a spending.
====

* To add a transaction:
`add dt/DATE_AND_TIME d/DESCRIPTION c/CATEGORY a/AMOUNT p/PERSON`

Examples:
`add dt/January 1st 2019, 07:00PM d/Printer ink c/Miscellaneous a/3.50 p/Janelle`


If the added transaction is negative which indicates a spending, it will be shown in the Reimbursement Tab as a pending reimbursement
record for the member that spent it. If there is an existing reimbursement record for that member still pending, the amount
of the newly added transaction will be added to the existing pending reimbursement amount.

* To delete an expense:
`delete INDEX` or `delete p/PERSON`

Examples:
** `delete 1`
** `delete p/Alex Yeoh`

* To edit a transaction:
`edit INDEX dt/DATE d/DESCRIPTION c/CATEGORY a/AMOUNT p/PERSON`

[NOTE]
The fields above can vary and be in different order. It is not compulsory to include all of them.

Examples:
** `edit 1 p/Bernice Yu dt/23-Aug-2019`
** `edit 3 a/12`

If the transaction intended to be deleted still has a pending reimbursement record, there will be an error response shown
and the deletion will not be allowed until the reimbursement record is marked as done.

* To sort:
** By date: `sort date`
** By person: `sort person`
** By amount: `sort amount`

The sort by date command will allow the user to view the table of transactions from the oldest to most recent.
The sort by person command will allow the user to view the table of transactions in alphabetical order.
The sort by amount command will allow the user to view the table of transactions from the one with the largest amount to the smallest amount.

* To un-sort:
`sort reset`

This command will allow the user to view the table of transactions in the order of when the current session of this application was just opened.


* To find:
`find KEYWORDS`

[NOTE]
The keyword can be one or more words. An entire keyword must match a word in the transaction intended to be found to be shown in the table
after the command. If the keyword is just a part of the word in the transaction, the transaction will not be shown in the table after the
command is inputted.

Examples:

** `find Alex Yeoh`
** `find Alex`

=== Inventory

====
* The inventory tab contains a detailed inventory of items belonging to the CCA for a variety of purposes. Each item will have 6 attributes: category, description, quantity, cost per unit, total cost, and price.
* The last attribute will be used for sales purposes.
* The inventory tab can be used in conjunction with the cashier tab by keeping track of the variety of items for sale and the remaining quantity of unsold products, as well as throw an error message via the lion if the cashier attempts to sell more than the specified quantity.
