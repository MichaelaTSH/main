[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above depicts the high-level design of treasurerPro.

treasurerPro is divided primarily into 6 packages:

. Transactions
. Members
. Reimbursement
. Inventory
. Cashier
. Overview

Each package shares a similar structure, consisting of the following components:

. <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the package.
. <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes commands sent to that package.
. <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the package in-memory.
. <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

The details on the structure of these components are located in the next few sections.
Alternatively, clicking on the names in the above list will bring you to the respective section.

Apart from the components above, treasurerPro also has the following shared components:

. Main
. MainWindow
. Commons

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializes each package in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down each package and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

`MainWindow` consists of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] class.
It defines a `TabPane` that holds `Tabs` for each of the Ui elements of the individual package, as well, as a `ScrollPane`
for Leo the Lion, our personal assistant.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `Log Center` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The processing of commands from a user depends on which tab the user is currently on, and consequently, which package will be invoked.
The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1` within the Transactions tab.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI component of each package is made up of an `AnchorPane` that holds UI elements based on what needs to be displayed.
For example, the Transactions package uses the `TableView` component, while the Overview package uses `PieChart`, `BarChart`,
and `LineChart` elements.

The UI of all packages inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the respective package's `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to respective package's `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

The above diagram shows the general design of the Logic component within each package. Further details on the
implementation of the Parser and Command can be found below in Section 3: Implementation.

. `Logic` uses the tab's `Parser` class to parse the user command.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person, transaction).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is a general Sequence Diagram depicting interactions within the `Logic` component.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for a Command
image::GeneralSequenceDiagram.png[]

Note that the diagram depicts only a general sequence of events within the `Logic` component.
More detailed Sequence Diagram's for commands in each Tab can be found in <<Implementation>>
Any deviations from this general sequence diagram will also be covered there.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference.
This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.
An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +

image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

[[Implementation]]
== Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
There are a total of 6 tabs in our application for each feature: Home Tab, Members Tab, Reimbursement Tab,
Inventory Tab, Cashier Tab, Overview Tab.

=== Home Tab
This tab will help to show records of individual transactions from miscellaneous spending, revenue from sales and
cost of buying items to sell.

Each transaction will require an input of its date, description, category, amount
and member that is accountable for it.

Revenue from each cashier checkout will also be automatically inputted as
a positive transaction in this tab with the person being the cashier. The inputted transactions that corresponds to
a spending will be tabulated for each member in the reimbursement tab to keep track of reimbursements.


This is the overall Class Diagram of this tab:

.Class Diagram of Home Tab (transaction package)

image::HomeTabClassDiagram.png[]

==== Add Command feature
The Add command is facilitated by the `VersionedtreasurerPro`. This command requires access to the `Model` of the
person package which the `AddressBook` implementation is contained in. All fields in the transactions are compulsory
to be inputted by the user: date, description, category, amount, person full name. The person's name inputted
has to match a name already existing in the `AddressBook` which is shown in our Members Tab.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add command works:

.Sequence Diagram of Add Command in Home Tab (transaction package)

image::HomeTabAddCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram shows the steps needed to add a new transaction:

.Activity Diagram of Add Command in Home Tab (transaction package)

image::HomeTabActivityDiagramAddCommand.png[]

As shown, when a user does not input all the compulsory fields or input a name that does not match anyone in
the `AddressBook`, a response to inform the user of the incorrect input is shown and when a successful addition is
done, a response message is shown as well by our mascot, Leo.

In addition, since the `resetPredicate()` method is called as shown, the UI table will immediately show the full
transaction list regardless of the list at the start of the activity diagram showing the filtered list
due to prior the inputted Find Command.

Since the reimbursement tab tabulates the amount to be reimbursed to a person, if the inputted amount is a negative
amount to indicate a spending that needs to be reimbursed, the reimbursement tab will update and show this record.

The following sequence diagram shows how the reimbursement `Model` and `Storage` is updated.
[[update-reimbursement]]
.Sequence Diagram of updating Reimbursement Tab (reimbursement package)

image::TransactionUpdatingReimbursement.png[]

This is done for every feature in the `LogicManager`.

==== Delete Feature
The Delete Command is facilitated by the `VersionedtreasurerPro`. This feature allows for 2 types of deletion, by
the index shown in the table or by the person's name. Inputting the person's name will cause all transactions linked to
that person to be deleted.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete by name command works:

.Sequence Diagram of Delete Command in Home Tab (transaction package)

image::HomeTabDeleteByNameCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

After this, the reimbursement tab is updated as shown in <<update-reimbursement,Figure 12>>.
The delete by index implementation would be similar but does not require interaction with the `Model` from the
`AddressBook` in the person package.

The following activity diagram shows the steps needed to delete a new transaction:

.Activity Diagram of Delete Command in Home Tab (transaction package)

image::HomeTabActivityDiagramDeleteCommand.png[]

The above activity diagram assumes the index to be within the bounds of the table but if it is not, a response will
be shown about the incorrect input. Also, as shown above, response on other incorrect inputs will also be shown.
When a successful deletion is done, a response message is shown as well.

In addition, since the `resetPredicate()` method is not called as shown, the UI table will continue to show the
filtered transaction list if the prior input is a Find Command and the list at the start of the activity diagram shows
a filtered list by the Find Command's keywords. To view the full transaction list, the user would have to input the
Back Command that calls `resetPredicate()`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the back command works:

.Sequence Diagram of Back Command in Home Tab (transaction package)

image::HomeTabBackCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Sort Feature
The Sort Command is facilitated by the `VersionedtreasurerPro`. This feature allows for 3 types of sort, by name in
alphabetical order, by amount (from most to least) and by date (from oldest to most recent).

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort command works:

.Sequence Diagram of Sort Command in Home Tab (transaction package)

image::HomeTabSortCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

When a user inputs the sort command, it is only checked that it is one of the 3 types or it will show a response about
the incorrect user input. When it is successfully sorted, there will also be a response message shown.

Similar to the Delete Command, since the `resetPredicate()` method is not called as shown, the UI table will
continue to show the filtered transaction list if the prior input is a Find Command and the list at the start
of the activity diagram shows a filtered list by the Find Command's keywords.
To view the full transaction list, the user would have to input the
Back Command that calls `resetPredicate()`.

==== [Proposed] Clear Command

==== [Proposed] Auto-complete feature



=== Members Tab
This tab will help to keep track of the contact details of members in the club or society for the treasurer.

==== Delete Feature
The Delete Command is facilitated by the `VersionedtreasurerPro`. This feature allows for deletion by
the index shown in the `Members Tab`. This tab integrates the existing `AddressBook`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete command works:

.Sequence Diagram of Delete Command in Member Tab (transaction package)

image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Before, the deletion is done, there will be a check to the `TransactionModel` to ensure that the member is not linked
to any transaction records since every transaction must be linked to a `Person` in the `Members Tab` (`AddressBook`).


=== Reimbursement Tab
This tab will help to show records of reimbursements
that treasurer needs to pay to a person.

Each reimbursement record is auto extracted from transactions.

The user can add deadline to a reimbursement, mark a reimbursement,
find a reimbursement and sort reimbursements.

This is the overall Class Diagram of this tab:

.Class Diagram of Reimbursement Tab (reimbursement package)

image::ReimbursementTabClassDiagram.png[]

==== Deadline Command feature
The deadline command is facilitated by the `VersionedtreasurerPro`. This command requires access to the `Model` of the
person package which the `AddressBook` implementation is contained in.
Deadline field should be provided in a valid date format. The
person's name inputted has to match a name already existing in the `Reimbursement` which is shown in our Reimbursement
Tab.

The following sequence diagram shows how the deadline command works:

.Sequence Diagram of Deadline Command in Reimbursement Tab (deadline package)

image::ReimbursementTabDeadlineCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]


As shown, when a user wants to add a deadline to a reimbursement by specifying
the person's name. The `DeadlineCommandParser` gets the person from `PersonModel` based on
person's name and creates a `DeadlineCommand` with person and deadline information.
This `DeadlineCommand` is returned back to `LogicManager` and is executed by calling `addDeadline` method in
`ModelManager`. After the operations, `LogicManager` gets updated reimbursement list from `ModelManager` and saves it.

==== Done Command feature

==== Find Command feature

==== Sort Command feature


=== Inventory Tab

This tab will help to keep records of all items currently in the club’s possession.
Each item will require an input of its description, category, quantity, and cost per unit. Optionally, if the item is meant for
sale, the price can be inputted as well.

This is the overall Class Diagram of this tab:

.Class Diagram of Inventory Tab (inventory package)

image::InventoryTabClassDiagram.png[]

==== Add Item Feature
This features allows the adding of items to the inventory.

When adding a new item, the user is required to input the description, category, quantity and cost per unit of the item.
The only attribute that is optional is the price.

For an input to be valid, it must contain all four of the previously mentioned attributes, and the input for each attribute
must be of the correct type. For example, quantity and cost must be numbers. However, the attributes can be inputted in any
order.

The following sequence diagram shows how an add command works with the description, category, quantity, cost and price fields
present:

.Sequence Diagram of Add Command in Inventory Tab (inventory package)

_{ to be added }_

The following activity diagram displays the process of adding a new item to the inventory:

.Activity Diagram of Add Command in Inventory Tab (inventory package)

image::InventoryAddCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

As shown above, the input will be evaluated for its validity. If the input is not valid, the user will be informed through Leo
that the command was in an invalid format and reminded of the correct format.

Otherwise, the user will be informed through Leo that their input was successful, and the item will immediately be displayed in
the Table of the UI.

==== Delete Item Feature

==== Edit Item Feature

==== Sort Items Feature

==== [Proposed] Auto-Complete Feature

=== Cashier Tab
This tab will act as a shopping cart to record sales item from the inventory that will contribute
to the sales made.

Only sales items can be added to the cart. If the price of the item is zero, it is not available for sale. The
system will prohibit the addition of such an item to the cart.

Adding of a sales item to the cart will require an input of its description and quantity. An optional field for
category is provided to guide the cashier to find the desired item.
Before every checkout, an existing person on the `Members Tab` must be set as the cashier-in-charge.

Revenue from every checkout will also be automatically inputted as
a positive transaction in `Home tab` with the cashier being the person-in-charge. For every sales made,
the quantity of each item will be updated accordingly in the `Inventory Tab`.

This is the overall Class Diagram of this tab:

.Class Diagram of Cashier Tab (cashier package)

image::UMLCashierTab.png[]

==== Add Sales Item Feature
This feature allows the adding of sales items to the cart.

Only description and quantity fields are required to be inputted by the user. If the category field
is input with other incomplete description and quantity fields, suggestions according to the specified category
would be shown by Leo, the assistant.

For the description field to be valid, it must match the description of an item in the inventory that is listed for
sale. For quantity field, the quantity specified must be positive and checks will be made to ensure that there is
sufficient stock in the inventory.

The following sequence diagram shows how an add command works with the description and quantity fields present:

.Sequence Diagram of Add Command (cashier package)

image::AddCommandCashierSeqDiag.png[]

As shown, when the user input an invalid description or quantity field without any category field, an appropriate response
message will be shown accordingly. If the category field is specified, suggestions according to that category
would be shown.
Checks will be done by the `Cashier Model` to ensure that the item specified is available for sale.

If description and quantity field are both valid, a response message will be shown, informing the user of the successful
addition of the sales item.

The following activity diagram shows the steps proceeding after the user input an add command:

.Activity Diagram of Add Command (cashier package)

image::AddCommandCashierActivityDiag.png[]

==== Edit Feature
This feature allows the editing of the quantity of sales item that are already added to the cart.
There are two ways to edit - by index or by description.

To edit by index, it will require an input consisting of the index and quantity fields. The specified index
should be row index of the item in the table shown on the Cashier tab.

To edit by description, it will require an input consisting of the description and quantity fields. The specified
description should match the description of an item in the table.

For the index field to be valid, it must be a positive integer and be within the size of the
table shown on the Cashier tab. For the quantity field to be valid, it must not exceed the stock
available in the inventory.

The following sequence diagram shows how an edit command works:

.Sequence Diagram of Edit Command (cashier package)

image::EditCommandCashierSeqDiag.png[]

If the inputted field are valid, a response message will be shown, informing the user of the successful
updating of the sales item.

As shown below, if the description of the item has been input, the model will return the index of that item
according to the specified description.

The following activity diagram shows the process after the user input an edit command:

.Activity Diagram of Edit Command (cashier package)

image::EditCommandCashierActivityDiag.png[]

==== Delete Feature
This feature allows the deleting of the items in the table shown on the Cashier tab.

To edit a specific item in the table, the only field required is the row index of the item in the table.

The following sequence diagram shows how a delete command works:

.Sequence Diagram of Delete Command (cashier package)

image::DeleteCommandCashierSeqDiag.png[]

If the index field is valid, the cashier model will delete the item from the sales list. The item will also be removed
from the table shown. A message informing the user of successful deletion will then be shown.

The following activity diagram shows the steps after the user input a delete command:

.Activity Diagram of Delete Command (cashier package)

image::DeleteCommandCashierActivityDiag.png[]

==== Setting the Cashier Feature
 This feature allows an existing person in the `Address Book` to be set as a cashier. The only field required is
 the name of an existing person.

`Members Tab` shows a list of existing members of the organisation.
To set a cashier, the specified person must be found on the `Members Tab`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the command works:

.Sequence Diagram of Set Cashier Command (cashier package)

image::SetCashierCommandCashierSeqDiag.png[]

If the person's name cannot be found in the `Model` of the person package, a response message will be shown by Leo,
informing the user that there is no such person. To input the person, the user have to add the details of the
person under the `Members Tab`.

If the specified name is valid, the `Model` of the cashier package will set the person as cashier.
After the cashier is set successfully, a response message will show, informing the user that the
cashier has been set successfully.

The following activity diagram shows the steps after the user input a set cashier command:

.Activity Diagram of Set Cashier Command (cashier package)

image::SetCashierCommandCashierActivityDiag.png[]

==== Checkout Feature
This feature confirms all the sales items in the table as sold and records the whole cart as a
transaction under the `Sales` category.

The `Transaction Tab` will be updated with the new transaction labelled as `Sales Items`.

The remaining stock of the sales items sold will be updated on the `Inventory Tab`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the checkout command works:

.Sequence Diagram of Checkout Command (cashier package)

image::CheckoutCommandCashierSeqDiag.png[]

As shown below, if the amount inputted is valid and the cashier has been set, the `Cashier Model` will create a new
transaction of the sales made. The remaining stock in the inventory will also be updated accordingly.
A clear command will then be called to clear all the sales items on the tab.

The `Cashier Logic` will write the updated inventory list and newly-generated transaction to the relevant data files.
To update the view on the `Inventory Tab` and `Transaction Tab`, transaction will be added to the transaction model and
`readInUpdatedList()` method of inventory model will called to read in the entire inventory data file.

The following activity diagram shows the steps after the user input a checkout command:

.Activity Diagram of Checkout Command (cashier package)

image::CheckoutCommandCashierActivityDiag.png[]

==== Clear Feature
This feature clears all the sales items in the table. This command is called after the cart has been checkout.
It can also be called by the user.

There is no required fields.

image::ClearCommandCashierSeqDiag.png[]

As shown below, after the clear command is called, the table will be emptied and the cashier will be set to null.

The following activity diagram shows the steps after the user input a clear command:

.Activity Diagram of Clear Command (cashier package)

image::ClearCommandCashierActivityDiag.png[]

=== Overview Tab

This tab displays summary statistics for the data within treasurerPro. There are four main statistics shown:

. Expense Summary: Pie chart of expenditure by category.
. Inventory Summary: Pie chart of inventory by category.
. Sales Summary: Bar chart of sales by months.
. Budget Overview: Line chart of budget remaining by months.

The above summaries are automatically updated whenever new data is entered from any of the other tabs.

The class diagram for this package is shown as follows:

==== Set command
For each summary statistic, the user may set targets that they plan to achieve/abide by.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature

==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book.
The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person.
The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore.
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore.
The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`.
Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`.
Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`.
Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged.
We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command.
This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice.
For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands.
Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
